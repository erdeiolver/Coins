Coins is the most complete and efficient plugin to manage a secondary economy in any server, it has a lot of features that you gonna love, everything is configurable, inclusive the command, you can send different messages to players depending on his game language, a multipliers system for networks, a integrated API for developers and much more!

## Features:
 - Customizable messages and command.
 - Multi lang, you can have different messages for any lang, the plugin will use the user's lang to get the corresponding file and if the message doesn't exist in that file the plugin gonna fallback to the messages.yml file.
 - BungeeCord support, you can put it in bungeecord to use the API if you need.
 - Command cost, you can add a cost to use commands.
 - Command Executors, you can create a list of commands that can be executed paying a specific amount of coins, see the config for more information. (you can create these in the BungeeCord config and will be available on every spigot server connected)
 - Sign executors, you can use executors in signs.
 - A internal cache to avoid too many queries to the Database.
 - The cache is updated through BungeeCord or RedisBungee if is present.
 - PlaceholderAPI support.
 - Vault support, the plugin can manage the entire server economy also across servers.
 - Multiplier, you can add a permission to players to get more coins or create multipliers that can be enabled for the entire server for a specific amount of time.
